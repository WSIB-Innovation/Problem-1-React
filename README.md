## Phase 1 – Parent & Child Components:
- Create a re-usable button React component using a functional structure.
- Pass props and a function from a parent component in order to define & change the button colours. 
- There should be 2 HTML buttons in total. Each button must have a unique background colour. 
- Clicking a button must change only its background colour.

## Phase 2 – Working With an API:
- You will be responsible for fetching data from the following API endpoint (this will return JSON containing 5 different comments) : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments
    - Note: Feel free to use the following website to find more information regarding the API:   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ 
- Using Phase 1, label one button “Fetch” and one button “Hide." When the user clicks on the button “Fetch,” your application must display JSON data fetched from the API endpoint linked above. When the user clicks on the button “Hide,” your application must hide the JSON data. 
- Feel free to style your application however you like! Please note: we are particularly keen on code quality. This means that code readability, reusability, functionality is our number #1 priority.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
